# Problem Statement

Libraries need a reliable way to manage book records efficiently. Manual records are error-prone and make searching for books difficult. My project solves this by providing a database-backed system for adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting book information.

## Scope and Audience

This project is intended for use by librarians, library assistants, and students who want to manage collections digitally.

## Main Features

- Persistent storage of book data (using SQLite3, library.db)
- Importing a dataset (books.csv) to populate the library automatically
- The dataset (books.csv) has 50 books data
- CRUD operations for books via a simple menu
- Easy deployment on any machine with Python installed
